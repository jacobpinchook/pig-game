# Description
- This is an application I developed in JavaScript while taking the course: "The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!" where two players compete to see who can reach 100 the fastest!
- Each player has the ability to roll the dice or stay with the number they have, adding the number they currently rolled up to into their total
- If the number 1 is rolled the active player will receive no points and forfeits their turn
